For beginners like me to learn the concepts in React

To run this example:

1. [Download this repo](https://github.com/phchu/react-countdown/archive/master.zip) or `git clone  https://github.com/phchu/react-countdown.git`
2. From the repo folder run:  
   `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser

And also head over to https://reactjs.org/ for some great documentation.
